# PresentMon

PresentMon is a tool to capture and analyze [ETW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) events related to swap chain presentation on Windows.  It can be used to trace key performance metrics for graphics applications (e.g., CPU and Display frame durations and latencies) and works across different graphics APIs, different hardware configurations, and for both desktop and UWP applications.

While PresentMon itself is focused on lightweight collection and analysis, there are several other programs that build on its functionality and/or helps visualize the resulting data.  For example, see

- [CapFrameX](https://github.com/DevTechProfile/CapFrameX)
- [FrameView](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/)
- [OCAT](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/OCAT)
- [PIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download/) (used as part of its [system monitor UI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/system-monitor/))

- [List of all releases](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/releases)

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to request features, report issues, or contribute code changes.

## Command line options

PresentMon needs to be run by a user who is a member of the "Performance Log Users" user group, or to be run with administrator privilege. If neither of these are true, you will get an error "failed to start trace session (access denied)".

To add a user to the "Performance Log Users" user group:

1. Run `compmgmt.msc` as administrator.
2. In the "Computer Management" window, expand "System Tools", expand "Local Users and Groups", and then click "Groups".
3. Double-click "Performance Log Users", and then click "Add".
4. In the "Enter the object names to select" text box, type the name of the user account or group account that you want to add, and then click "OK".
5. Sign out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

If PresentMon is not run with administrator privilege, it will not have complete process information for processes running on different user accounts.  Such processes will be listed in the console and CSV as "<error>", and they cannot be targeted by name.

| `-session_name name`     | Use the provided name to start a new realtime ETW session, instead of the default "PresentMon".

(See discussion above).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Comma-separated value (CSV) file output

### CSV file names

By default, PresentMon creates a CSV file named `PresentMon-TIME.csv`, where `TIME` is the creation time in ISO 8601 format.  To specify your own output location, use the `-output_file PATH` command line argument.

If `-multi_csv` is used, then one CSV is created for each process captured and `-PROCESSNAME` appended to the file name.

If `-hotkey` is used, then one CSV is created for each time recording is started and `-INDEX` appended to the file name.

### CSV columns

## Known issues

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/issues) for a current list of reported issues.

### Analyzing OpenGL and Vulkan applications

Applications that do not use D3D9 or DXGI APIs for presenting frames (e.g., as is typical with OpenGL or Vulkan applications) will report the following:

- Runtime = Other.
- SwapChainAddress = 0
- SyncInterval = -1
- PresentFlags = 0
- msInPresentAPI = 0

In this case, TimeInSeconds will represent the first time the present is observed in the kernel, as opposed to the runtime, and therefore will be sometime after the application presented the frame (typically ~0.5ms).  Since msUntilRenderComplete and msUntilDisplayed are deltas from TimeInSeconds, they will be correspondingly smaller then they would have been if measured from application present.  msBetweenDisplayChange will still be correct, and msBetweenPresents should be correct on average.

### Measuring application latency

PresentMon doesn't directly measure the latency from a user's input to the display of that frame because it doesn't have insight into when the application collects and applies user input.  A potential approximation is to assume that the application collects user input immediately after presenting the previous frame.  To compute this, search for the previous row that uses the same swap chain and then:

```LatencyMs =~ msBetweenPresents + msUntilDisplayed - previous(msInPresentAPI)```

### Shutting down PresentMon on Windows 7

Some users have observed system stability issues when forcibly shutting down PresentMon on Windows 7.  If you are having similar issues, they can be avoided by using Ctrl+C in the PresentMon window to shut it down.
